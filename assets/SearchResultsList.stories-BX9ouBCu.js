I'm Jane Houston Jones at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. 
Earth is a little closer to the sun so it orbits a little faster, and Mars is a littler farther away from the sun so it orbits a little bit slower. 
But every two years or so we get really close to Mars 
And we have what's called opposition. 
That means that Mars and the sun are on opposite sides of the Earth. 
If you just step outside and look to the East, after the sun sets, you'll see a bright orange star-like object and that's Mars and it's brighter than anything else in the sky. There's nothing else brighter. 
Some of the features through a telescope will look sort of like a peachy color and kind of a dark gray color on some of the other features. 
To see those colors you really will need a larger telescope but you'll still be able to see some contrast through the very smallest telescope. 
The north polar area of Mars is really interesting and really worth looking at this month because Mars is just ending its winter and during the wintertime on Mars' north pole, there's a cloud that covers the ice caps. 
As Mars finishes winter and begins spring, this polar cloud starts to dissipate and underneath the cloud is where the polar ice cap is. 
Now we're not sure if we'll be able to see it in December or not but you won't know without looking. 
This month if you want to see the side of Mars where the rover Spirit is, look at the beginning and at the end of the month. 
And for Opportunity, you'll want to look at Mars on the 15 th. 
You won't be able to see the rovers, even with a telescope but it's really nice to know where they are. 
Besides the rovers, there are several spacecraft that are orbiting the planet. 
Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter are just two of them. 
The European Space Agency's Mars Express is also orbiting.

Mars Pathfinder, a lander carrying a small rover and science instruments to Mars, has less than half of its total distance to complete now, said Dr. Robin Vaughan, Pathfinder navigation team member at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The spacecraft will overtake Mars Global Surveyor at 0100 Universal Time on March 15 (5 p.m. Pacific Standard Time tonight, March 14). At the time of the event, Mars Pathfinder will be 43.7 million kilometers (27 million miles) from Earth and 69.7 million kilometers (43.2 million miles) from Mars. The spacecraft is more than halfway along its arcing flight path, on which it will have traveled a total of 497 million kilometers (309 million miles) by the time it reaches Mars. "Although Pathfinder was launched about a month after Mars Global Surveyor, it is traveling faster than Surveyor and is on a shorter flight path to the red planet," said Brian Muirhead, Pathfinder project manager at JPL. "Whereas Mars Global Surveyor will take 10 months to reach Mars, Pathfinder takes only seven months. Once we reach Mars, we dive directly into the Martian atmosphere. The descent will only take about four minutes, and we should be on the surface of Mars by about 10 a.m. Pacific time on July 4th." Pathfinder is on a different type of trajectory to Mars than Mars Global Surveyor. Called a "Type 1" trajectory, the spacecraft does not have to travel as far to intercept Mars. Mars Global Surveyor will log a total of 700 million kilometers (435 million miles) in its flight path toward the red planet. "The advantage to using a Type 1 trajectory is that you have to travel less than one-half of the way around the Sun to intercept Mars," Vaughan said. "So Pathfinder takes 212 days to reach Mars, while Mars Global Surveyor will spend 309 days to reach the planet." Mars Global Surveyor is on a "Type 2" trajectory, taking it more than 180 degrees around the Sun to intercept the planet. A major difference in this type of trajectory is that the spacecraft travels at a slower velocity with respect to the Sun. Subsequently, the craft requires less fuel to slow down at Mars than if it had followed Pathfinder's trajectory. For instance, Pathfinder is currently traveling at 27 kilometers per second (60,700 miles per hour), while Mars Global Surveyor is traveling at about 26.75 kilometers per second (59,800 miles per hour). "Less fuel translates into simpler, smaller spacecraft and less expense," said Glenn Cunningham, Mars Global Surveyor project manager. "Mars Global Surveyor also will employ a fairly new technique requiring very little fuel to drop down into its mapping orbit. The technique is called 'aerobraking,' and takes advantage of the drag of the Martian atmosphere. As the spacecraft dips down into the top of the atmosphere at its closest point to the planet each orbit, the drag from the atmosphere on the spacecraft will reduce its orbital speed. This drops the altitude of the highest part of the orbit, changing it from the initial elliptical shape to the circular shape required for mapping the planet." Aerobraking was first demonstrated successfully with the Magellan spacecraft, which mapped the surface of cloud-covered Venus using a sophisticated radar-imaging system. Magellan aerobraked into the Venusian atmosphere in October 1994, sending back data about Venus' thick sulfur and carbon dioxide-choked atmosphere until it burned up in the planet's sizzling temperatures. Mars Global Surveyor, however, will not dip so far into the much thinner Martian atmosphere that it would burn up. Pathfinder is scheduled to perform two more flight path corrections and, possibly, a fifth maneuver to keep it on course for landing on Mars on July 4. The last two maneuvers will occur near the end of the cruise phase, on May 7 and June 24, when the spacecraft is close to Mars. If necessary, a fifth maneuver will be executed just a few hours before entry into the Martian atmosphere on July 4. Mars Global Surveyor will perform its second trajectory correction maneuver on March 20. Engineers are continuing to explore possible ways of freeing a broken damper arm that is wedged in the joint of one of the solar arrays, so that the panel locks in place. The Mars Pathfinder and Mars Global Surveyor missions are managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C. Pathfinder is the second in NASA's Discovery program of low-cost spacecraft designed to carry out highly focused science goals. Mars Global Surveyor is the first spacecraft in a decade-long program of robotic exploration, called the Mars Surveyor Program. 818-354-5011`],news_news__release_number:"1997-9722",news_news__get_topic_titles_filter:`Solar System
