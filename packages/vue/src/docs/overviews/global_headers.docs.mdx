# Headers

Headers are to be placed at the very top of your website or application. Header styles are specific to your site's visibility (internal vs. external/public). If you are using the [Internal Theme](?path=/docs/foundation-themes--docs#internal-theme), be sure to use the [Internal Header](?path=/docs/global-layout-headers-for-internal-sites--docs). If your website or application is public-facing, be sure to use the External header (coming soon).

Note: to view with functioning dropdowns and search field expansion, you must go to [an individual story and switch to **Canvas View**](?path=/story/global-layout-headers-for-internal-sites--default).

<ComponentList
  components={[
    {
      heading: 'Internal Header',
      meta: HeaderInternalStories,
      path: '/docs/global-layout-headers-overview--docs',
      fullWidth: true,
      fullCanvas: true
    }
  ]}
/>

A header for public-facing (external) sites is coming soon.
