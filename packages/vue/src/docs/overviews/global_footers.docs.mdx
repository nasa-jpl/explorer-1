# Footers

Footers are to be placed at the very bottom of your website or application. Footer styles are specific to your site's visibility and theme (internal vs. external/public). If you are using the [Internal Theme](?path=/docs/foundation-themes--docs#internal-theme), be sure to use the [Internal Footer](?path=/docs/global-layout-footers-for-internal-sites--docs). If your website or application is public-facing, be sure to use the External footer (coming soon).
