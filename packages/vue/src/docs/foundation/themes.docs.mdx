# Themes

Throughout this storybook, you can use the Theme and Variant selectors in the Storybook toolbar to preview components in different theme configurations.

**Note:** some documentation pages use iframes to display components, which ignores the theme switcher. Thus, for the most accurate representation of the internal theme, we recommend viewing the story in isolation.

## Dynamic color tokens

There are dynamic color tokens in place that use a semantic name instead of a specific color name. These tokens are use strategically in components to support multiple themes.

Changing the Theme and Variant to see how the dynamic tokens change.

## Light & Dark Variants

`.ThemeVariantLight` and `.ThemeVariantDark` in Explorer 1 are theme variants. Note that not all components support these variants.

### Key Points

- `defaultTheme` and `ThemeVariantLight` are the defaults
- It is recommended that page templates always include the default variant.

### Contributing developers: Writing light/dark theme styles for components

For components that have light and dark themes, add theme rules to the end of your scss. The following is an example of a component whose background should be `bg-white` by default and in `ThemeVariantLight` but `bg-black` in `ThemeVariantDark`

```css
.MyComponent {
  // set the default background color
  @apply bg-white;
  // set the ThemeVariantDark background color
  .ThemeVariantDark & {
    @apply bg-black;
  }
}
```

## Adaptive Text Colors

Usage of `.text-action` vs `.text-action` in the context of `.ThemeVariantLight` and `.ThemeVariantDark` ensures that the contrast of the text color is sufficient against the background color. These adaptive text colors are supported by all themes.

### Definition (excerpt)

```css
.text-action {
  @apply text-action;
  .ThemeVariantDark & {
    @apply text-action-light;
  }
}
.text-action-hover {
  @apply text-action-dark;
  .ThemeVariantDark & {
    @apply text-action;
  }
}
```

### Usage

Try changing the Theme and Variant while viewing the examples below. Notice how there are slight changes in color between the Dark and Light variants.
