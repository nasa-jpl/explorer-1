# MixinCarousel

This is a `swiper.js` wrapper for the carousels that consist of multiple cards in view that also bleed to full width.

<Canvas of={Stories.BaseStory} />

### Variants

There are currently two variants that can be applied via the `variant` prop. These are used to to apply a class to the main wrapper that dictates subtle changes to the layout. For the most part, these have to do with the vertical placement of the navigation arrows.

| Variant | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cards` | This is the default variant and accommodates cards that have text below the image. This places the navigation arrows in the vertical center of an image with a 16:9 aspect ratio. |
| `tiles` | This places the navigation arrows in the vertical center of the entire slide                                                                                                      |

## Basic Usage

The default slot should be your slides, and each slide must have the `.swiper-slide` class.

### Option with a link in the top right

And with a link using the `link` and `linkTitle` props:

<Canvas of={Stories.BaseCarouselWLink} />

## Used in the following components
