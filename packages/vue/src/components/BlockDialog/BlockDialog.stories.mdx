# BlockDialog

This component is an accessible dialog window that utilizes the efficient and lightweight `a11y-dialog` package.
It adheres to the [Dialog (Modal) pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/) outlined in the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) Authoring Practices Guide.

Additionally, it is unopinionated with styling.

<Canvas
  of={Stories.BaseStory}
  className="sbdocs-preview-full-width"
/>

### Basic Usage

To trigger dialog opening, use the `data-a11y-dialog-show` attribute with the value set to the `id` of the dialog element you want to open.

```
<button type="button" data-a11y-dialog-show="your-dialog-id">
  Open the dialog
</button>
```
