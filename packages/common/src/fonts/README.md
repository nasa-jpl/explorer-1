# Fonts

Font files are intentionally not tracked in this repo. To use the correct fonts locally:

1. Retrieve fonts from this repo: https://github.com/nasa-jpl/explorer-1-fonts/tree/main/core/fonts/helvetica-now
2. Place `woff2` files directly in the `helvetica-now` folder of this repo (`/packages/common/src/fonts/helvetica-now/`)
