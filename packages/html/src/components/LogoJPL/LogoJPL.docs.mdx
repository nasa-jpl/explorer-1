# JPL Logo

The JPL Logo has strict color usage restrictions and should only be used on internal sites, namely in the [AppBar](?path=/docs/global-layout-headers-for-internal-sites-elements-overview--docs).

You can change the size of the logo by using [TailwindCSS width classes](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/width). Explorer 1 includes other widths not documented by Tailwind. You can find all custom widths in the [appendix](?path=/docs/appendix-tailwindcss--docs), in the `extend.spacing` object.
