# Getting Started Guide for Designers

Designers are encouraged to browse through the Explorer 1 Storybook to become familiar with the design system and its offerings and limitations. Most of the documentation is developer-focused, but the following sections provide helpful overviews:

## Design system foundations

- [Colors](?path=/docs/v2-docs_foundation-colors--docs)
- [Typography](?path=/docs/v2-docs_foundation-typography--docs)
- [Icons](?path=/docs/v2-docs_foundation-icons--docs)
- [Grid and Layout](?path=/docs/v2-docs_foundation-grid-and-layout--docs)

## Components

Explorer 1 comprises components that range from very simple, single-purpose elements to complex combinations of multiple other components. We've categorized these into a few broad buckets, but the lines between them are blurry. Learn more about the types of components offered by Explorer 1 and how to use them by starting on our [Components overview](?path=/docs/v2-docs_components-overview--docs) page.
