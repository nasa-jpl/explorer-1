# Typography

## Fonts

Below are all fonts used in the design system.

### Metropolis

Metropolis is used for all heading levels and body copy.

### Archivo Narrow

Archivo Narrow is used for subtitles and buttons and is always used in UPPERCASE.

## Text Colors

Here are colors intended for text, depending on the background. **Note:** Some of these colors will not pass contrast requirements if used on a different background.

<Canvas of={Stories.TextColor} />

## Text Styles

All of the text styles used across the project, each with its reusable component class.
Prefer reusing those classes over individual utility classes, as each text style has different properties between desktop and mobile viewports.

Note:

- All heading levels also have the corresponding text styles directly applied for convenience.
- This can still be overridden by adding another relevant class.

<Canvas of={Stories.TextStyles} />

### Heading Icons

We can also add icons next to the headings.

<Canvas of={Stories.HeadingIcons} />

## Text Contrast

In areas where text overlays an image, use this `.text-contrast` class in conjunction with a semi-transparent overlay (ex. `bg-black/*`) to improve readability. `.text-contrast` also works with tailwind breakpoints.

<Canvas of={Stories.TextContrast} />
