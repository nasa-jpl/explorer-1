# Column Layout helpers

Sometimes you may want to use a few common column indentations in your layouts for blocks on your page. Explorer 1 provides a few helper classes to aid in quickly creating these indented blocks. These helper classes also include responsive fallbacks.

## .indent-col-base

`.indent-col-base` is the **base class that you must add to any element that will use additional helper classes covered in this documentation**. Its immediate parent must be `.BaseGrid` (or any 12-column grid). It sets the width to start at the first column and end after the last column, i.e. full width.

```css
.indent-col-base {
  @apply col-start-1 col-end-13; // full width of 12 grid container
}
```

<Canvas
  className="sbdocs-preview-full-width"
  of={Stories.BaseWidth}
/>

## .indent-col-2

`.indent-col-2` adds to `.indent-col-base` by overriding the `col-start` and `col-end` for `lg` screens to indent content to the **second** column.

```css
.indent-col-2 {
  @screen lg {
    @apply col-start-2 col-end-12;
  }
}
```

<Canvas
  className="sbdocs-preview-full-width"
  of={Stories.ColTwoStart}
/>

## .indent-col-3

`.indent-col-3` adds to `.indent-col-base` by overriding the `col-start` and `col-end` for `lg` screens to indent content to the **third** column.

```css
.indent-col-3 {
  @screen lg {
    @apply col-start-3 col-end-11;
  }
}
```

<Canvas
  className="sbdocs-preview-full-width"
  of={Stories.ColThreeStart}
/>

## .indent-col-4

`.indent-col-4` adds to `.indent-col-base` by overriding the `col-start` and `col-end` for `lg` screens to indent content to the **fourth** column, and at `md` screens to the **third** column.

```css
.indent-col-4 {
  @screen md {
    @apply col-start-3 col-end-11;
  }

  @screen lg {
    @apply col-start-4 col-end-10;
  }
}
```

<Canvas
  className="sbdocs-preview-full-width"
  of={Stories.ColFourStart}
/>
