# Explorer 1

## JPL's Design System

Consisting of working code, design components, guidelines and resources, JPL's Design System for digital experiences, Explorer 1 helps JPL's product teams build more efficently, at scale, and on brand. It is maintained by JPL's DesignLab team and regularly evolves to meet the changing needs of the Lab. Upcoming improvement plans can be seen on our [Roadmap page](https://designlabinternal.domain/storybook/?path=/docs/roadmap--page).


##### GOALS:

The design system aims to help UI consistency and quality, streamline the design and development process and provide guidance for design and development efforts.

## Design System Benefits

##### EFFICIENCY

Designers no longer need to repeatedly rebuild components from scratch. A shared library of components streamlines this process and leaves little room for error.

##### CONSISTENCY

Having a shared set of principles and rules to build components makes it easier to create consistent user experiences that accurately reflect JPL across a variety of platforms.

##### SCALE

Increased efficiency and consistency facilitate building products that scale
