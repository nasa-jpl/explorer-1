# Components

Explorer 1 comprises components that range from very simple, single-purpose elements to complex combinations of multiple other components. We've categorized these into a few broad buckets, but the lines between them are blurry.

- **[Base](?path=/docs/components-base-overview--docs)** components are the simplest elements that sometimes stand on their own, but more often are used in combination with others to assemble larger components. Examples include [BaseLink](?path=/docs/components-base-baselink--docs), [BaseButton](?path=/docs/components-base-basebutton--docs), and [BaseHeading](?path=/docs/components-base-baseheading--docs).
- **[Blocks](?path=/docs/components-blocks-overview--docs)** are components that combine multiple other components or are otherwise more complex. Examples include [BlockImage](?path=/docs/components-blocks-blockimage--docs), [BlockQuote](?path=/docs/components-blocks-blockquote--docs), and [BlockTeaser](?path=/docs/components-blocks-blockteaser--docs).
- We also break out **[Form](?path=/docs/components-forms-overview--docs)** and **[Search](?path=/docs/components-search-overview--docs)** components into their own groups because they have their own significant complexities that relate to their user interactions.
- [Mixins](?path=/docs/components-mixins-overview--docs) are intended for developer use when creating new components, but aren't meant to be used alone. General users of Explorer 1 usually don't need to refer to these mixins.

## Base vs. block components

To illustrate the difference between base and block components, consider images. We have both `BaseImage` and `BlockImage` components. The difference is that `BaseImage` is nothing more than the `<img>` element (with our minimum set of attributes, wrapped in a div), whereas `BlockImage` combines a `BaseImage` with a `BaseImageCaption` (plus a few other bells and whistles).

<ReactDocsComponentList
  components={[
    {
      heading: 'BaseImage',
      customDescription: 'Just an image, nothing else.',
      meta: BaseImageStories,
      path: '/docs/components-base-baseimage--docs',
    },
    {
      heading: 'BaseImageCaption',
      customDescription: 'Just the caption.',
      path: '/docs/components-base-baseimagecaption--docs',
      meta: BaseImageCaptionStories,
    },
    {
      heading: 'BlockImage',
      customDescription:
        '`BlockImage` = `BaseImage` + `BaseImageCaption`, plus adding support for expanding the image in a lightbox and styling it to be a full-bleed image.',
      meta: BlockImageStories,
      path: '/docs/components-blocks-blockimage--docs',
      fullWidth: true,
    },
  ]}
/>
