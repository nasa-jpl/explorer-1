# Explorer 1

## JPL's Design System

Consisting of working code, design components, guidelines, and resources, JPL's design system for digital experiences—called **Explorer 1**—helps JPL's product teams build more efficiently, at scale, and on brand. It is maintained by JPL's DesignLab team and regularly evolves to meet the changing needs of the Lab.

##### GOALS:

The design system aims to help UI consistency and quality, streamline the design and development process and provide guidance for design and development efforts.

## Design System Benefits

##### EFFICIENCY

Designers no longer need to repeatedly rebuild components from scratch. A shared library of components streamlines this process and leaves little room for error.

##### CONSISTENCY

Having a shared set of principles and rules to build components makes it easier to create consistent user experiences that accurately reflect JPL across a variety of platforms.

##### SCALE

Increased efficiency and consistency facilitate building products that scale
