# Getting Started Guide for Developers

To use the Explorer 1 design system, there are three things you will need:

1. [The @nasa-jpl/explorer-1 npm package](#using-the-npm-package)
2. [Familiarity with the design system foundations](#design-system-foundations)
3. [Components and HTML templates](#components-and-html-templates)

## Using the npm package

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@nasa-jpl/explorer-1)](https://npmjs.com/package/@nasa-jpl/explorer-1)

This package includes all of the frontend assets (JS and SCSS) necessary to create components using the HTML markup examples in this Storybook. For information on how to install and use the npm package, please refer to the [@nasa-jpl/explorer-1 README](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/explorer-1).

## Design system foundations

Usage of the Explorer 1 design system is based on utility CSS classes, specifically Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. We recommended becoming familiar with [how to use Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

Browse the [Foundation section](?path=/docs/foundation-colors--page) of this Storybook to become familiar with how to use utility classes for:

- [Colors](?path=/docs/foundation-colors--page)
- [Typography](?path=/docs/foundation-typography--fonts)
- [Icons](?path=/docs/foundation-icons--arrow)
- [Grid and Layout](?path=/docs/foundation-grid-and-layout--base-grid)

## Components and HTML templates

Explorer 1 comprises components that range from very simple, single-purpose elements to complex combinations of multiple other components. We've categorized these into a few broad buckets, but the lines between them are blurry. Learn more about the types of components offered by Explorer 1 and how to use them by starting on our [Components overview](?path=/docs/components-overview--page) page.

### HTML templates

HTML templates are provided by this Storybook in both Docs view and Canvas view. You can also modify the component "controls" to customize the component.

#### How to copy HTML snippets from Docs view

1. Find the story block you want to copy.
2. In the bottom right corner of the block, click on "Show code".
3. In the bottom right corner of the now-visible code block, click on "Copy".

#### How to copy HTML snippets from Canvas view

Canvas view is useful to isolate your view to a single rendition of the component. Some components are also only available in Canvas view.

1. To switch to Canvas view, find the component you want and click on the "Canvas" tab in the upper left.
2. Make sure addons (the tabbed pane under the rendered component) are enabled by clicking on the three dots to the right of the JPL logo and checking "Show addons", or by typing `A`. If you still don't see the addons pane, you may need to toggle "Change addons orientation" in the menu (or type `D`) a couple times.
3. Click on the "HTML" tab within the addons pane.
4. Click on "Copy" in the bottom right of the screen or manually copy and paste the code block.
5. You can also customize the component by modifying the controls in the "Controls" tab within the Add-ons viewer. The code will update to match.
