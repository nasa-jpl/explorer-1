# Getting Started Guide for Developers

To use the Explorer 1 design system, there are three things you will need:

1. [The @nasa-jpl/explorer-1 npm package](#using-the-npm-package)
2. [An understanding of how to use the base styles](#base-styles-and-brand-identity)
3. [HTML templates](#html-templates)

## Using the NPM package

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@nasa-jpl/explorer-1)](https://npmjs.com/package/@nasa-jpl/explorer-1)

This package includes all of the frontend assets (JS and SCSS) necessary to create components using the HTML markup examples in this Storybook. For information on how to install and use the npm package, please refer to the [@nasa-jpl/explorer-1 Documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nasa-jpl/explorer-1).

## Base Styles and Brand Identity

Browse the [Brand Identity section](?path=/docs/brand-identity-colors--page) of this Storybook to become familiar with how to use:

- Colors
- Typography
- Icons
- Grid and Layout, including how to construct a responsive layout

The Brand Identity section also includes code examples of how to use Tailwind CSS classes.

## HTML templates

HTML templates are provided by this Storybook in both Docs view and Canvas view. You can also modify the component "controls" to customize the component.

### How to copy HTML snippets from Canvas view

Canvas view is useful to isolate your view to a single rendition of the component. Some components are also only available in Canvas view.

1. To switch to Canvas view, find the component you want and click on the "Canvas" tab in the upper left
2. Make sure "Add-ons" are enabled by clicking on the three dots to the right of the JPL logo, or typing `A`. If you still don't see the Add-ons, you may need to toggle "Change addons orientation" or type `D` a couple times.
3. Click on the "HTML" tab within the Add-ons viewer
4. Click on "Copy" in the bottom right of the screen or manually copy and paste the code block.
5. You can also customize the component by modifying the controls in the "Controls" tab within the Add-ons viewer. The code will update to match.
