Configurable to accommodate just an AppBar or complex site navigation, along with optional search and sign in/out buttons.

Note: to view with functioning dropdowns and search field expansion, you must switch to <strong>Canvas View</strong>.

## Configuring dropdowns and menu items

The create your own menu items, you can either copy the html template as rendered here and manually edit as needed, or you can populate the `menuItems` array to have the template generated for you in Storybook. Either way, be sure that each menu item is given a unique id.

To populate the `menuItems` array, a specific structure for each object in the array must be followed. Use the examples below as starting points to construct your array. You can then update the `menuItems` value in the [Props Table](#props) at the top of the page (or in Canvas view). Be sure to switch to raw data values when doing this.

Items in `menuItems` can be given a property of `isActive: true` to highlight them with a red underline to indicate that they are the page you are on (or section you are in).

### Example of a single menu item, no dropdown

```json
{ "id": 1, "title": "Home", "url": "#" }
```

The navigation assumes you are using relative links for local links and will auto-detect external links by checking for `h` (as in http or https) at the beginning of the url string.

```json
{ "id": 7, "title": "External", "url": "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/" }
```

This data would create similar navigation links such as "Home" and "External" in the example [at the top of this page](#top)

### Example panel with a simple combination

One highlight, and several single-level nav items.

<Canvas
  class="sbdocs-preview-full-width"
  meta={NavInternalPanelStories}
  of={NavInternalPanelStories.Default}
/>

<Controls
  of={NavInternalPanelStories.Default}
  include={['menuItems', 'highlights']}
/>

### Example panel with no highlights

<Canvas
  class="sbdocs-preview-full-width"
  meta={NavInternalPanelStories}
  of={NavInternalPanelStories.NoHighlights}
/>

Note the lack of `highlights` in the data structure below:

<Controls
  of={NavInternalPanelStories.NoHighlights}
  include={['menuItems', 'highlights']}
/>

### Example panel with highlights only

<Canvas
  class="sbdocs-preview-full-width"
  meta={NavInternalPanelStories}
  of={NavInternalPanelStories.AllHighlights}
/>

Note the lack of `menuItems` in the data structure below:

<Controls
  of={NavInternalPanelStories.AllHighlights}
  include={['menuItems', 'highlights']}
/>

### Example panel with navigation headings

<Canvas
  class="sbdocs-preview-full-width"
  meta={NavInternalPanelStories}
  of={NavInternalPanelStories.WithHeadings}
/>

Note the nested `menuItems` array within each top-level `menuItem`. For more details on how these work, view the nav [Section](?path=/story/global-layout-headers-for-internal-sites-elements-panel--with-headings) documentation.

<Controls
  of={NavInternalPanelStories.WithHeadings}
  include={['menuItems', 'highlights']}
/>

### Example panel with a more complex combination

One highlight, section headings, and allowing breaks across columns.

<Canvas
  class="sbdocs-preview-full-width"
  meta={NavInternalPanelStories}
  of={NavInternalPanelStories.Combination}
/>

<Controls of={NavInternalPanelStories.Combination} />

> In all of the above examples, `allowSectionBreaks` and `allowSectionColumns` can be modified as needed. For information on what these are, see documentation on the Internal Navigation [Panel](?path=/story/global-layout-headers-for-internal-sites-elements-panel--default)

<span id="just-the-appbar"></span>

## Just the AppBar

<Canvas of={Stories.AppBarOnly} />

<Controls of={Stories.AppBarOnly} />

### With Sign In buttons

<Controls of={Stories.AppBarWithSignIn} />
